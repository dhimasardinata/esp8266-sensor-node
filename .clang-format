# --- Indentation & Spacing ---
IndentWidth: 2
TabWidth: 2
UseTab: Never
ColumnLimit: 120 # Modern screens are wide; 80 is too restrictive.
AccessModifierOffset: -2 # Aligns 'public:' with 'class'
NamespaceIndentation: All # Indents code inside namespaces (cleaner)

# --- Include Sorting (The Fix) ---
SortIncludes: CaseSensitive # Sorts includes alphabetically
IncludeBlocks: Regroup # Automatically groups headers (std, lib, local) with newlines

# --- Pointers & References ---
# Modern C++ prefers 'Type* var' (the pointer is part of the type)
# Google default is Right ('Type *var'), but Left is more logical in C++.
PointerAlignment: Left
ReferenceAlignment: Pointer

# --- Wrapping & Breaking ---
BreakBeforeBraces: Attach # { on the same line (K&R/One True Brace Style)
AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: Empty # Only empty functions {} on one line
AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine: Never # Always break if statements (safer for debugging)
AllowShortLoopsOnASingleLine: false

# --- Arguments & Parameters ---
# If args don't fit on one line, stack them vertically (one per line).
# This makes Git diffs much cleaner.

# --- C++20 Specifics ---
# Essential for formatting 'requires' clauses and Concepts nicely
IndentRequiresClause: true
BreakBeforeConceptDeclarations: true

# --- Consistency ---
FixNamespaceComments: true # Adds // namespace foo at the end automatically
SortUsingDeclarations: true # Sorts 'using' statements
